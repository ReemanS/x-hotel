Welcome to X-Hotel, and we hope you enjoy your stay!

This is a project that we have done as a requirement for our CIT 211 - System Integration and Architecture course. It showcases a simple booking system for the fictitious X-Hotel, with options to query specific types of rooms based on the capacity, level of comfort, and the available dates.

Currently, the system is not functional as write requests have been disabled. However, you may still explore and have a look at the interface.
